  An Augmented Reality<br>
  Online Review Market  
</p>

<h1> Experience the restaurant. <br>
See the dishes. <br>
Know what to expect.</h1>

<h2>Vision</h2>
You look up a new restaurant on Yelp but wonder what kind of dishes and what the environment and the ambience is like in the restaurant. But unfortunately the pictures won’t do because you don’t know the actual size and the pictures of the restaurant are only partial areas of the place. <br>
Our pitch deck can be seen [here.](http://www.slideshare.net/MarikaLee1/tolen-pitch-deck)


<h2>Solution</h2>
Our solution is to create basically a Virtual Reality Yelp along with the environement view and the menu's associated with their dishes. <br>
Tolen will offer <br>
1. A clickable menu of the restaurant to view dishes as holograms. <br>
2. 360 degrees video of the restaurant. <br>
3. For restaurants to showcase their dishes as holograms to the customers before they order their food.<br>
Therefore restaurants and users can give better impressions of their best-rated dishes. 

<h2>Current Market</h2>
Hungry people with smartphones are looking to eat right now. According to "Mobile Path-to-Purchase", it was found that mobile search behavior - by people who search the Internet for good food using their phones or tablets - has a nearly 90 percept conversion rate. This only goes to show that this industry has a huge target demographic of potential users of Tolen. Knowing what to expect at the restaurant such as the type of dishes, environment and ambience have a significant influence on mobile business searches. Therefore our product lets users enter the restaurant to get the feel of the place before they even arrive.


<h2>Target Market</h2>
Our target market is everyone! In particular people who like to know what they expect at the restaurant before they enter. Foodies. Young people. Old people. Everyone. Because AR and VR technologies are the up and coming new "thing" for this 21st century, we want to shift Yelp-like reviews to a more new-age platform.


<h2>Use Case</h2>
    1. You’re looking for a restaurant to eat at for the first perfect date
    2. You want to know everything about the place and what dishes and environment you’re expecting. You want this date to be perfect.
    3. Open up VR Yelp and bam you’re virtually at the restaurant and now you know what you will be expecting!

<h2>Business Model</h2>
Our primary revenue stream will be advertising package subscriptions to companies that list their businesses on Tolen. Also sponsored search where local businesses pay Tolen for traffic to their website. Sponsored search will allow businesses to move their links to first Search Engine Results page (SERP).
